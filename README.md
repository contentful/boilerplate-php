# Welcome to your Contentful PHP Boilerplate

To use this boilerplate you need to have PHP 5.5.9 or newer. On Windows you also need to have [composer](https://getcomposer.org) installed.

## Get the code

Clone the project using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/contentful/boilerplate-javascript.git`

## Start the project

### macOS / Linux

Open your terminal, navigate to this folder and run `./run.sh`. That's it!

### Windows

On Windows, copy the `index.php` and `composer.json` to the web server root you usually use and run `composer install`. Now go to your webbrowser and open the `index.php` file.
