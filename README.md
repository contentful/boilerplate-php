# Welcome to the PHP Boilerplate

To use this boilerplate you need to have PHP 5.5.9 or newer. On Windows you also need to have [composer](https://getcomposer.org) installed.

## Get the code

Clone the project using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/contentful/boilerplate-javascript.git
```

## Start the project

### macOS / Linux

Open your terminal, navigate to this folder and run `./run.sh`. That's it!

### Windows

On Windows, copy *index.php* and *composer.json* to the web server root you usually use and run `composer install`. Open the *index.php* path in your web browser.
